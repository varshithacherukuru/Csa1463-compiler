Algorithm CountVowelsAndConsonants(sentence):
    vowelCount = 0
    consonantCount = 0
    for each character in sentence:
        if character is an alphabet:
            character = convert character to lowercase
            if character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u):
                increment vowelCount
            else:
                increment consonantCount
    return vowelCount, consonantCount
